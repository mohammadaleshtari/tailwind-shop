        Iranian rice is the most prime in the world. Tarem and Hashemi are the
        two most popular rice brands in the country. Tarem and Hashemi rice is
        grown in the best rice fields in the province of Mazandaran and after
        its quality is tested in Golestan laboratories, it is packed and sold.
        The smell and taste of Golestan rice are not comparable with those of
        rice produced by other companies.
